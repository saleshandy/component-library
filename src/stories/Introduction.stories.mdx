The Saleshandy design system came to bring a series of benefits and to solve common problems in the development workflow.

### The main benefits are:

---

- Keep visual consistency between components, pages and projects
- Create easily maintainable components
- Develop a common language between Design and Front-end teams
- Single source of truth to style code
- Faster development of pages and features (keeping quality and isolation of code)
- Using css as base, the consumer applications can use almost any technology or framework such as React and css-in-js libraries

### Get started

---

- <b>Explore UI components:</b> Click on any of the component in the sidebar to see
  how they look, and how to configure them. Each component pages contains documentation
  of its properties, as well as code examples for how to use it.
- <b>Try them out:</b>

  - Experiment with different properties, by clicking Canvas at the top of each component page and pressing "a" to show Addons.
  - Change the properties under Controls in the bottom panel.

- <b>Use them:</b> Once you've found the right component for your use case, click
  the Docs tab to see the code implementation.
